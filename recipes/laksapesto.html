    <h2>The dish that will take your breath away</h2>
    <p>When it comes to laksa-inspired dishes, the iconic <strong><u>Laksa Pesto Linguine</u></strong>  by Mod-Sin pioneer Willin Low remains a firm favourite for many local food lovers. 
    The dish came about rather serendipitously. When chef Willin first opened Wild Rocket, his landlord curiously asked if they would have a laksa on the menu. 
    That sparked something in him, and he decided to come up with a creation that reinvented the classic Singapore dish. </p>
