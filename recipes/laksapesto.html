    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Yes, it's supposed to taste this way!" - <em>Jessica Chan 2014</em></p>
    <p>Proceeds to give the student the <strong>LOWEST</strong> grade in the class for cooking this particular dish </p>
    <p>When it comes to laksa-inspired dishes, the iconic <strong><u>Laksa Pesto Linguine</u></strong>  by Mod-Sin pioneer Willin Low remains a firm favourite for many local food lovers. 
    The dish came about rather serendipitously. When chef Willin first opened Wild Rocket, his landlord curiously asked if they would have a laksa on the menu. 
    That sparked something in him, and he decided to come up with a creation that reinvented the classic Singapore dish. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups fresh laksa leaves,packed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 chilli padi</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of candle nuts & sun flower seeds</li>
        <li>1 bulb garlic cloves,minced</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the laksa leaves in with the nuts and seeds, pulse a few times in a food processor.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimps and garlic, pulse a few times more.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the olive oil in a constant stream while the food processor is on. Stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor with a rubber spatula.</li>
